# Graph class template

This project was created because I was doing several different projects or assignments that involve Graphs... and for each I continuously had to re-write the same Graph object for the project. 

This will serve as a template for future Graph based projects so that I can get straight to implementing the project instead of having to monotonously create a Graph object from scratch.


## TODO:

- Utilizie pyplot for a network graph display

- Make this a pip package?

- Boolean option for undirected vs directed

- Boolean option for checkRep or not (for large data)

- Shortest path from one node to another

- Different representations of a graph (coordinates?)
